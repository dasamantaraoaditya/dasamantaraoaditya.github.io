Cause i alone can love u even if u dont love me or not. But if u love me in return then it would be even more blessing. Okay today i am thinking of writing this to u cause i want to give this writtings as a present for u on ur birthday . these writtings may contain a lot of crap which u may think like i am over acting but its true for me. today I am going to give a simple demo of me with u and our journey of life till now. I met u when I was in my 3rd year and till now we are almost every possible thing we could be. you were a sister.lover.friend.class mate.knowlege center.my guide when I do wrong and also a life partner. first I want to confess that I watch girls and look at them .it is the same with any of the guy.i don't know what is the issue with girls or so, but guys they find girls intresting cause they might not Have some things that girls may have and they find this interesting. you are the best thing that ever happend to me. at the first time I met u I was thinking like every girl is going to look at me like a brother and finally I am going to fail to act like a boy any more. ya and I also wanted to state this one thing which I haven't told u until u asked me . about sushmita .. there really is no girl names sushmita that was me talking to myself and she ie sushmita was my imaginary girlfriend of that time. later I felt like a stupid and started to live in the real world more. at that time we were not that close cause u haven't talked to me more and I started to hate myself and the things that I connect to. but sravani was my sister back then and I beloved that's that u think about me too. later when I got to know that ramarao was involved with u as a lover and rejected u I started scolding him to love a girl. but on the other side I started to think that when girls doesn't want to love then why don't they say in the beginning that I am not interested in loving. by the way later I changed my complete prospective of girls and boys to human beings and started to live a simple and lonely life which I loved a lot. there used to be me and my family and my friends at my home. then u came back into my life saying that I am ur sister ie lovely sister and I played along with u imposing what I feel about life. but to be Frank during my days with u one day I really felt like having u as mine once when I was really lonely and was crying out because I really don't understand anything about life one side family problems and another side money problems and u too sympathy on me and called me and showed ur condolences. then during my day at Park I really found peace and am happy to lead the rest of my life in the same manner . that time u started calling me and those days I started to be more and more close to u. I always used to think that every one has some or other people as relatives and I am single . look ugly and that to a guy who is looking like a kid irrespective of age . but my friends really made them forgotten. then came my college life and college friends. this life was awesome . then I got this feeling like why to get cared by someone I will start caring other people. this life turned out to be awesome and I am glad that u are a part of this life. then the life turned out up side down when other people are getting married and got to know that one day every one I love is going to get married and they are going to go away from my life. this was when maneesha is getting married and this time I super imposed things like have curly hair with blue dress and other things on u . cause i wanted to look at my girl. then I went to the wedding like a normal person would go to. when I wanted to look at u I have no clue where u are and suddenly u appeared like an angle and that was the first time I felt like kissing u for a long time. but I was still in the same mode of thinking u are my sister. I spent the nit I mean the complete night with u and was like when is the correct time to touch u or kiss u or do any possible thing just with u. I was scared that what u might think about me or what might other people think about us. I don't think u remember but on that day we were on the roof only u and me. no one else Were on the roof I don't know whether I have a bad idea or not that time I tried to kiss u."+

That nit i was with u the whole time and i really liked it and i love it. That nit i slept along with u in the same bead and i liked it a lot we were like a family Then when i came back to the mid-1 again u were there waiting for me and i was like more than a siter it would be great if u were a wife to me in future even though i know it is not possible. Then comes the most memorable day, going again to a movie and sitting along with u. I really wasnt watching the movie, i was watching u and imagining my llife with u as a girlfriend. Then the mirror maze and u kissing me on my cheeks and other things happend i still have those images and i will treasure them forever. Then when we went to park as a team u left me even without telling me . that day i cried a lot i mean a really lot i cried like a baby and couldnt even breath. then if i really think back and gather all y memories with u like 1)comming to ur house 2)finding u in college 3)missing u all these things turned out to be love. That day i was like if u werent there for me then i would better be dead, and it turend out u were rigt there for me and startrd loving u. March 13: Today i am going to write a love letter to u : sravani oh my dear sravani ..

I didnt even consider that me goingout with my friends would hurt u or even bother u cause i really and sincearly love u from the bottom of my heart. I played a lot of games with u and i wish those games are going to become true. I want to be ur husband and u to be my wife and have good days like the one in which we played. I know some day u are going to leave me even though u may like it or not. That day will be the saddest day of my life . I am fortunate to meet u and even know the day before head. I never want to hurt u , i really want u to become a strong women who can live a independent and healthy life able to facce any situation and happy life. Being selfish to make u happy in future made me take some hard decisions too . I agree that i cry and cryed and will cry too . I cry a lot thinking about u , if u are crying then it is my fault and if u are happy then it is your strenght on ur own.i will love u unconditionally. Sorry to make u cry for so may days noe u are much more stronger than what u were before and this change in is developed by u urself. A samll request from me, if we could not get married then please love ur husband more than me and take good care of him and if u want u can forget about me. if u are still remembring me then thanks. I dont want to be some person who is going to ruine ur relationship. It is so stupid that i am crying and writting this text sorry my tears come often i guess this is what love is and why we need stay away from it. But i will love u. Dont schold my friends for my actions, i am going to take the punishment and i am taking it . U know what more than what u are suffering i am suffering more and more , i cry so hard that taking breath became difficult thinking about u. I have hurted u and made u cry sorry really really sorry. Ya one more thing dont hide anything from me just say it, even if it is like some one is bothering u or u are having any problems. You are so beautiful and good person. People are after u and ur beauty and good nature i guess a lot of people preposed u and u even rejected them this itself makes u stand in the heighest position much above than me. I am the worst possible person u can meet in ur life and thanks for sticking around along with me. I am short ugly bad and more over bad natured person and i cant even belive that u like me. U often ask me whether i love u or not and i always reply u that i love u . But i never asked once whether u love me or not cause u loving me is a great thing. for me to even touch is live going to heven.Rather than that i asked u to kiss me lip to lip, which u are not going to do any way. god to know that u understand english. if u really kiss me then i will be the most most most happiest person and dangerous person that time cause i will get the feeling like i can defeat anything with ur kiss. Finally i cant even enf this my feelings are flowing likea a relm of words and sentances. I love u sravani Thats it Happy birthday. The work that i was saying that i was doing is making this page and adding content to this page from last 5 days. I love u. </p> </article> </section> <h1>These are my treasure</h1> <section id='latest' class='last clear'> <article class='one_quarter'> <figure><img src='srav1.jpg' width='215' height='315' alt=''> <figcaption>Bujji And Cute</figcaption> </figure> </article> <article class='one_quarter'> <figure><img src='srav2.jpg' width='215' height='315' alt=''> <figcaption>I want to bite you</figcaption> </figure> </article> <article class='one_quarter'> <figure><img src='srav3.jpg' width='215' height='315' alt=''> <figcaption>I want to kiss you</figcaption> </figure> </article> <article class='one_quarter lastbox'> <figure><img src='srav4.jpg' width='250' height='315' alt=''> <figcaption>I want to have children with u</figcaption> </figure> </article> <article class='one_quarter lastbox'> <figure><img src='srav5.jpg' width='215' height='315' alt=''> <figcaption>I want to marry you</figcaption> </figure> </article> <article class='one_quarter lastbox'> <figure><img src='srav6.jpg' width='200' height='315' alt=''> <figcaption>How much cute an u be :O</figcaption> </figure> </article> <article class='one_quarter lastbox'> <figure><img src='srav7.jpg' width='515' height='315' alt=''> <figcaption>What ever it is I love u Sravani</figcaption> </figure> </article> </section> <!-- / One Quarter --> </div> <!-- / content body --> </div> </div> <!-- Footer --> <div class='wrapper row3'> <footer id='footer' class='clear'> <p class='fl_left'>Copyright &copy; 2012 - All Rights Reserved - <a href='#'>Sravani and Aditya</a></p> </footer> </div> "
